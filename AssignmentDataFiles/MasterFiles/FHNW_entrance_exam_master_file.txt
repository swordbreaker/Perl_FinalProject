Complete this exam by placing an 'X' in the box beside each correct
answer, like so:

    [ ] This is not the correct answer
    [ ] This is not the correct answer either
    [ ] This is an incorrect answer
    [X] This is the correct answer
    [ ] This is an irrelevant answer

Scoring: Each question is worth 2 points.
         Final score will be: SUM / 10

Warning: Each question has only one correct answer. Answers to questions
         for which two or more boxes are marked with an 'X' will be scored as zero.

________________________________________________________________________________

1. The type of a Perl variable is determined by:

    [X] Nothing: Perl variables don't have a static type
    [ ] The name of the variable
    [ ] The type of the first value placed in the variable
    [ ] The compile-time type declarator of the variable
    [ ] Random chance

________________________________________________________________________________


2. Perl's three main types of call context (or "amount context") are:

    [ ] List, linear, and void
    [ ] List, scalar, and null
    [ ] Null, scalar, and void

3. The "default variable" (or "topic variable") is:

    [X] $_
    [ ] @_
    [ ] $$
    [ ] $=
    [ ] The last variable that was successfully assigned to

________________________________________________________________________________

7. The difference between a 'my' variable and an 'our' variable is:

    [X] 'my' variables are lexically scoped; 'our' variables are package scoped
    [ ] 'my' variables are subroutine scoped; 'our' variables are block scoped
    [ ] 'my' variables are compile-time; 'our' variables are run-time
    [ ] 'my' variables must be scalars; 'our' variables must be arrays or hashes

    [ ] ...only if it controls exactly one statement
    [ ] ...only if it controls two or more statements
    [ ] ...only if the statements it controls include any variables declarations

    [X] elsif
    [ ] elseif  (with no whitespace between the two words)
    [ ] else if (with any amount of whitespace between the two words)
    [ ] elif
    [ ] ormaybe (with no whitespace between the two words)

________________________________________________________________________________


14. "Short-circuiting" of a boolean expression means...

    [X] ...Perl evaluates as little as required to get a definite answer
    [ ] ...Perl only evaluates each boolean expression once during the program
    [ ] ...Perl defers evaluating the expression until the result is tested
    [ ] ...Perl will never execute an 'else' block
    [ ] ...Perl programs can cause CPUs to spark if an expression is too complex

________________________________________________________________________________


15. A "foreach-style" loop (such as: for (@list) {...}) will be iterated...

    [X] ...once per element in the list, unless a 'last' is executed in the block
    [ ] ...once per element in the list in all circumstances
    [ ] ...endlessly, until a 'last' is executed in the loop
    [ ] ...an unknown number of times, until the list being iterated is empty
    [ ] ...never, because an array is not a list and cannot be iterated

________________________________________________________________________________

    [X] ...iterates until its condition is false at the start of an iteration
    [ ] ...iterates until its condition is true at the start of an iteration
    [ ] ...iterates until its condition becomes false anywhere within its block
    [ ] ...iterates until its condition becomes true anywhere within its block

    [ ] 0, '0', 'false', 'False', 'FALSE'
    [ ] 0, +0, -0, 0.0, -0.0
    [ ] False, Nil, Null, None, Empty

________________________________________________________________________________


19. If the array @x contains four elements,
    how many elements will be in the list (1, @x, 2)?

    [X] Six:   the four array elements will be flattened into the list
    [ ] Eight: 1 * 4 * 2 = 8
    [ ] Three: the array will become a single element within the list
    [ ] Two:   Perl ignores non-scalar variables in a list constructor
    [ ] None:  it won't compile; arrays can't be used in list constructors

________________________________________________________________________________


20. A hash variable stores...

    [X] Values of any scalar type, indexed by keys that are always strings
    [ ] Values of any scalar or list type, indexed by keys that are always strings

    [ ] Random values, indexed by sequential keys of any type

________________________________________________________________________________


21. The expression 1 / 'Inf' produces the result:

    [X] 0 (because that's the correct mathematical outcome)
    [ ] 1 (as a convenience, to avoid subsequent division by zero)
    [ ] A non-fatal warning (because 'Inf' is a string, not a number)
    [ ] A fatal exception (because 'Inf' is a string, not a number)
    [ ] An infinite evaluation loop; the program will run forever

________________________________________________________________________________


22. A "reference" in Perl is most like:

    [X] A type-safe immutable pointer to an existing value or variable
    [ ] A mutable pointer to a value or variable, without type-checking
    [ ] An alias (i.e. another name) for an existing variable
    [ ] A deep copy of an existing variable or value
    [ ] A link to the documentation for an existing value or variable

________________________________________________________________________________


23. In Perl, you can take references to...

    [X] ...scalars, arrays, hashes, and subroutines
    [ ] ...scalars, arrays, and hashes, but NOT subroutines
    [ ] ...scalars and arrays, but NOT hashes or subroutines
    [ ] ...arrays and hashes (i.e. containers), but NOT scalars or subroutines
    [ ] ...only scalars (NOT to arrays, hashes, or subroutines)

________________________________________________________________________________


24. User-defined subroutines are declared with the keyword:

    [X] 'sub'
    [ ] 'subroutine'
    [ ] 'fun'
    [ ] 'do'
    [ ] Nothing: subroutines are not explicitly declared in Perl

________________________________________________________________________________


25. By default, the arguments to a subroutine call are passed in which variable?

    [X] @_
    [ ] $_
    [ ] @ARGV
    [ ] @ARGS
    [ ] $ARGV

________________________________________________________________________________

26. Which of the following parameter lists declares
    a subroutine that requires at least two arguments,
    but which will also accept three or more arguments?

    [X] sub two_or_more ($flag, @data)           {...}
    [ ] sub two_or_more ($flag, $data)           {...}
    [ ] sub two_or_more ($flag, $data = @extras) {...}
    [ ] sub two_or_more ($flag, ...)             {...}
    [ ] sub two_or_more (@flag, @data)           {...}

________________________________________________________________________________


27. If a user-defined subroutine does not contain a 'return' statement...

    [X] ...it will return the value the last expression it actually evaluates
    [ ] ...it will return the value the final statement in its definition
    [ ] ...it will return 'undef'
    [ ] ...it will throw an exception after executing its final statement
    [ ] ...it will never return and will continue to execute forever

________________________________________________________________________________

    [X] 'die'
    [ ] 'throw'
    [ ] 'raise'
    [ ] 'except'
    [ ] 'exit'

________________________________________________________________________________


29. How are exceptions are caught and accessed in Perl?

    [X] Caught in an 'eval' block;  accessed via the special $@ variable
    [ ] Caught in a 'try' block;    accessed via a 'catch' block
    [ ] Caught in a 'do' block;     accessed via the builtin 'eval' function
    [ ] Caught in a 'catch' block'; accessed via the special $! variable
    [ ] Exceptions in Perl can't be caught or accessed after they're thrown

________________________________________________________________________________


30. What is the purpose of the 'use strict' pragma?

    [X] It disallows undeclared variables, barewords, and symbolic references
    [ ] It converts all warnings to fatal errors
    [ ] It disallows package variables (all variables must be declared with 'my')
    [ ] It reports all errors using verbose (and harshly worded) error messages
    [ ] It prevents any construct that might also be valid C code
